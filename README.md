The code is used to detect certain trends of wildfire gasses in past 2 decades. This specific project uses CO data from giovanni databases to formulate analytical 
results such as long-term trend, mean rolling average, anomalies, etc. In turn these trends will help with wildfire evaluations, predictions, and prevention for future 
California fires. Also note that the data and code is split based on northern and southern California as both areas have different weather conditions that may provide 
different reasons for the increase in wildfires. The satellite used for this data is Merra-2 Reanalysis with a spatial resolution of 0.5 x 0.625 and a temporal
resolution of monthly.
